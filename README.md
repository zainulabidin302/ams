# Assignment Management System

Assignment Management system helps teachers (mostly at university level) to create and discuss assignments with students in an interactive and easy way. The differene between **ASM** and other cms or education cms systems is in the simplicity of AMS.

### Options

AMS don't have to many options yet but we want AMS to be simple and to the point solution for assignment management rather then a jack of all solution. AMS has a very small learning curve for users as well as teachers.

Even if more options are added, it is important to trun complexity to simplicity and give a comprehensive uesr interface and minimal user interaction (in the sense that system should take care for most functions and user is only enjoying reports and trying to improve his learning)

### Plagarism

There is a great amount of work required here. In the first version of ASM, we will start to look diff algorithms and match assignment text between different users.

### Assignment Format

Assignment can be files in pdf, excel sheets, word documents, or plain text documents.

### Roles and Permission
At the top level, there are 3 roles which are *student* and *teacher* and *teacher-assistant*.
